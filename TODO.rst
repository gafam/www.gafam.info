- [o] Implement "poster autolayout" proof of concept:

      Try to layout the poster in CSS/Javascript for easier reproduction
      of translated versions without having to do a manual layout step.

      Use Fitty (https://rikschennink.github.io/fitty/) for the job.

      Or have a look at FitText or FlowType:
      https://discourse.wicg.io/t/auto-sizing-text-to-fit-container/1053

  See https://github.com/posterkit. This is still pre-alpha! ;]

    the lovely people of LQDN in covering the whole world.
